## 🧪 How to Test (Need 2 Accounts)

### Step 1: Create User A
1. Open app in one browser/device
2. Login with phone number (e.g., `+31612345678`)
3. Go to Friends tab → Click "Add Friends"
4. You'll see empty tabs (no friends yet)

### Step 2: Create User B  
1. Open app in **different browser/incognito** or another device
2. Login with **different phone number** (e.g., `+31698765432`)
3. Go to Friends tab

### Step 3: Send Friend Request (User A → User B)
**As User A:**
1. Click "Add Friends" button
2. Enter User B's phone: `+31698765432`
3. Click the arrow **→** button
4. Should see: "Success! Friend request sent!"
5. Go to **"Sent"** tab
6. ✅ You'll see User B's number there!

### Step 4: Accept Request (User B)
**As User B:**
1. Refresh the Friends screen (close and reopen if needed)
2. Go to **"Requests"** tab
3. ✅ You'll see User A's request!
4. Click **"Accept"**
5. Go to **"Friends"** tab
6. ✅ User A is now your friend!

### Step 5: Check Both Sides
**User A:**
- Go to "Friends" tab → ✅ See User B
- "Sent" tab → ❌ Request is gone (accepted)

**User B:**
- "Friends" tab → ✅ See User A
- "Requests" tab → ❌ Request is gone (accepted)

## 🎬 What Each Tab Shows

### Friends Tab
- Shows all your current friends
- Can click "Remove" to unfriend someone

### Requests Tab (Inbox)
- Shows people who want to be YOUR friend
- **Accept** → They become your friend
- **Decline** → Request disappears

### Sent Tab
- Shows requests YOU sent to others
- Waiting for them to accept/decline
- **Cancel** → Remove your request

## 🚀 Under the Hood

### When You Send a Request:
```javascript
// Firestore creates a document:
{
  from: "your-user-id",
  to: "their-user-id",
  status: "pending",
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

### When They Accept:
```javascript
// 1. Request status → "accepted"
// 2. Both users get each other added to friends[] array
// 3. Request disappears from UI
```

### When You Cancel or They Decline:
```javascript
// Request status → "cancelled" or "declined"
// Request disappears from UI
```

## 🔥 Firebase Setup Required

### 1. Update Firestore Rules
See `FIRESTORE_RULES_SETUP.md` for the exact rules to copy/paste

### 2. Required Collections
- **users** - Stores user profiles and friends list
- **friendRequests** - Stores all friend requests
- **videos** - Stores video metadata

These are created automatically when you use the app!

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### "No user found with this phone number"
**Problem:** The other user hasn't signed up yet  
**Fix:** Make sure both users have logged in at least once

### Request doesn't appear immediately
**Problem:** Screen didn't refresh  
**Fix:** Close and reopen the Friends Management screen

### "Friend request already sent"
**Problem:** You already sent a request to this person  
**Fix:** Check your "Sent" tab - it's already there!

### Can't see friend requests
**Problem:** Firestore rules not updated  
**Fix:** Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules → Publish the new rules from `FIRESTORE_RULES_SETUP.md`
