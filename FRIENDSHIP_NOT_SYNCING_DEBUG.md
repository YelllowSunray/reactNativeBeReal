---

## Step-by-Step Debug Process

### **User A (Request Sender) - On First Device**

#### Step 1: Send Friend Request
1. Open **Console** (F12)
2. Go to Friends tab
3. Enter User B's phone number
4. Click "Send Request"
5. **WATCH THE CONSOLE!**

**Expected Output:**
```
🔍 Searching for user with phone: +31612345678
✅ User found: +31612345678
📤 Sending friend request...
   From (me): UserA_ID_abc123
   To (friend): UserB_ID_def456
💾 Creating friend request doc with data: {...}
✅ Friend request created with ID: request_xyz789
📝 Request details:
   - Request ID: request_xyz789
   - From: UserA_ID_abc123
   - To: UserB_ID_def456
   - Status: pending
🔄 Reloading friend requests to update UI...
📤 Loaded 1 sent requests
```

✅ **If you see this** → Request was sent successfully!
❌ **If you DON'T see this** → Copy the error message

---

### **User B (Request Receiver) - On Second Device**

#### Step 2: Check Received Requests
1. Open **Console** (F12)
2. Go to Friends tab → **Requests** tab
3. **WATCH THE CONSOLE!**

**Expected Output:**
```
📬 Loading friend requests for user: UserB_ID_def456
📥 Loading RECEIVED requests (where to == my user ID)
   My user ID: UserB_ID_def456
📊 Found 1 raw received request docs
📬 Processing received request request_xyz789: {
  from: "UserA_ID_abc123",
  to: "UserB_ID_def456",
  status: "pending"
}
   ✅ Found sender user: +31698765432
✅ Loaded 1 received requests
```

✅ **If you see "Found 1 raw received request docs"** → Request arrived!
❌ **If you see "Found 0 raw received request docs"** → Request didn't save to Firebase!

#### Step 3: Accept the Request
1. Click **Accept** button
2. **WATCH THE CONSOLE CAREFULLY!**

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Accepting friend request...
   Request ID: request_xyz789
   From user: UserA_ID_abc123
   My user ID: UserB_ID_def456
📝 Updating request status to "accepted"...
   ✅ Request status updated
👥 Adding users to each others friends lists...
   📝 Adding UserA_ID_abc123 to my (UserB_ID_def456) friends list...
   ✅ Added to my friends list
   📝 Adding me (UserB_ID_def456) to UserA_ID_abc123's friends list...
   ✅ Added to their friends list
🎉 Users are now friends!
🔄 Reloading friends and requests...
👥 Loading friends for user: UserB_ID_def456
📖 Fetching user document to get friends array...
📋 User has 1 friend IDs: ["UserA_ID_abc123"]
   📖 Loading friend data for UserA_ID_abc123...
   ✅ Found friend: +31698765432
✅ Loaded 1 friends
```

**CRITICAL CHECKPOINTS:**
- ✅ "Request status updated" - Request was marked accepted
- ✅ "Added to my friends list" - You got them as friend
- ✅ "Added to their friends list" - They got you as friend (THIS IS KEY!)
- ✅ "User has 1 friend IDs" - Your friends array updated

---

### **User A (Original Sender) - Back to First Device**

#### Step 4: Check if Friendship Appeared
1. Switch to Friends tab (or refresh)
2. **WATCH THE CONSOLE!**

**Expected Output:**
```
👀 FriendsScreen focused - refreshing data
👥 Loading friends for user: UserA_ID_abc123
📖 Fetching user document to get friends array...
📋 User has 1 friend IDs: ["UserB_ID_def456"]
   📖 Loading friend data for UserB_ID_def456...
   ✅ Found friend: +31612345678
✅ Loaded 1 friends
```

✅ **If you see "User has 1 friend IDs"** → Friendship synced! 🎉
❌ **If you see "User has 0 friend IDs"** → Firebase update failed!

## 🔥 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Found 0 raw received request docs"
**Problem:** Friend request never saved to Firebase

**Check:**
1. Open Firebase Console
2. Go to Firestore Database
3. Click **friendRequests** collection
4. Do you see a document with:
   - `from`: UserA's ID
   - `to`: UserB's ID
   - `status`: "pending"

**If NO document exists:**
- ❌ Firestore rules might be blocking writes
- Check Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules tab
- Make sure authenticated users can write to `friendRequests`

### Issue 2: "Permission denied" or "Missing permissions"
**Problem:** Firestore security rules are too strict

**Fix:**
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Firestore Database → Rules tab
3. Update rules to allow authenticated users:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to send/receive friend requests
    match /friendRequests/{requestId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to upload videos
    match /videos/{videoId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

4. Click **Publish**

### Issue 3: Request Accepted but "User has 0 friend IDs"
**Problem:** The `arrayUnion` update to users collection failed

**Check Console For:**
```
❌ Error accepting friend request: FirebaseError: ...
```

**Verify in Firebase:**
1. Go to Firestore → **users** collection
2. Find User A's document
3. Look for `friends` field (should be an array)
4. Does it contain User B's ID?
5. Find User B's document
6. Look for `friends` field
7. Does it contain User A's ID?

**If friends arrays are empty:**
- ❌ Permission issue on users collection
- Update Firestore rules (see Issue 2)

### Issue 4: Auto-refresh not working
**Problem:** User A needs to manually refresh to see friend

**Workaround:**
- Switch away from Friends tab and back
- Or just wait 5 seconds (auto-refresh runs every 5 seconds)

**This is NOT ideal but means the sync IS working, just delayed**

## 🔍 Manual Firebase Check

**Check if friendship was actually saved:**

### Step 1: Check Friend Request
1. Firebase Console → Firestore
2. Click **friendRequests** collection
3. Find the request document
4. Check `status` field:
   - Should be "accepted" ✅
   - If still "pending" ❌ → Accept function didn't run

### Step 2: Check User A's Friends Array
1. Click **users** collection
2. Find User A's document (use phone number to identify)
3. Look for `friends` field
4. Should be an array containing User B's ID
5. Example: `friends: ["UserB_ID_def456"]`

### Step 3: Check User B's Friends Array
1. Still in **users** collection
2. Find User B's document
3. Look for `friends` field
4. Should be an array containing User A's ID
5. Example: `friends: ["UserA_ID_abc123"]`

**If BOTH users have each other in friends arrays:**
✅ Firebase sync is working!
❌ The problem is in the frontend loading

**If friends arrays are empty or missing:**
❌ Firebase update failed (permission issue most likely)

## 📤 What to Send Me

If it's still broken, send me:

1. **Console logs** from BOTH devices (User A AND User B)
2. **Screenshot of Firebase** showing:
   - friendRequests collection (the specific request)
   - users collection (both users' documents with friends arrays)
3. **Tell me which step failed:**
   - Sending request?
   - Receiving request?
   - Accepting request?
   - Loading friends?

The console logs + Firebase screenshot will tell us EXACTLY what's wrong! 🔍

---

## Quick Test

**Fastest way to check if Firebase sync is working:**

1. User B accepts request
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Open Firebase Console
4. Check BOTH users' `friends` arrays
5. If they BOTH contain each other's IDs → Firebase works, frontend doesn't
6. If arrays are empty → Firebase permission issue
