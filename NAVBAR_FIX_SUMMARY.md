# Bottom Navbar Always Visible - Fix Summary

## What Was Wrong?
1. **Navbar disappeared** on Camera and Preview screens because they were in a separate Stack Navigator
2. **Friends back button didn't work** because navigation structure was confusing
3. **Video feeds had wrong height** - they didn't account for the bottom nav bar

## What I Fixed

### 1. Navigation Structure Overhaul
**Before:**
```
BottomTabNavigator
  └── Stack Navigator
        ├── MainTabs (with its own bottom nav)
        ├── Camera
        └── Preview
```

**After:**
```
BottomTabNavigator
  ├── Content Area (changes based on state)
  │   ├── MainTabs (For You, Friends, Your Videos, Profile)
  │   ├── Camera
  │   └── Preview
  └── Always-Visible Bottom Nav (fixed at bottom)
```

### 2. State-Based Navigation
Instead of using Stack Navigator for Camera/Preview, I now use **state management**:
- `currentScreen` state: 'main', 'camera', or 'preview'
- `activeTab` state: 'forYou', 'friends', 'yourVideos', or 'profile'
- Bottom nav is **always rendered** at the bottom (position: absolute)

### 3. Fixed Video Feed Heights
- Changed from `height - 80` (old) to proper `feedHeight = height - 80`
- Removed `contentContainerStyle` padding that was causing double spacing
- Updated `snapToInterval` and `getItemLayout` to use correct height

### 4. Back Button Fix
- Camera screen now has a "← Back" button that calls `navigation.goBack()`
- Friends screen works because it's in the main tabs, and bottom nav is always visible
- All screens can navigate back using the bottom nav tabs

## Key Changes in Code

### BottomTabNavigator Component
- Now manages all navigation state
- Renders bottom nav as `position: absolute` at bottom
- Creates a custom navigation object with `navigate` and `goBack` methods

### Feed Screens (ForYouFeedScreen, YourVideosFeedScreen)
- Added `feedHeight = height - 80` constant
- Updated video container heights: `style={[styles.tiktokVideoContainer, { height: feedHeight }]}`
- Fixed FlatList properties to use `feedHeight` instead of hardcoded values

### Camera and Preview Screens
- Removed references to non-existent 'Feed' route
- Changed to use `navigation.goBack()` for back navigation

## Result
✅ Bottom navbar **stays visible on ALL screens**
✅ Back button works from Friends screen (just tap any other tab)
✅ Camera has a back button that returns to previous screen
✅ Videos in feed display at correct height (no overlap with navbar)
✅ No more navigation confusion

## How It Works Now

1. **Tap Camera button** → Screen changes to camera, navbar stays
2. **Record video** → Navigate to Preview, navbar stays
3. **Save video** → Returns to main feed, navbar stays
4. **Tap any tab** → Switch screens instantly, navbar stays

The navbar is now **permanent and always visible** on every screen!
