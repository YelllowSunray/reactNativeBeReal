## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### **"Can't see Edit Profile button"**
- Make sure you completed the profile setup first
- Refresh the app

### **"Changes not saving"**
- Check Firebase Console for any errors
- Make sure you're connected to internet
- Check Firestore Rules allow updates

### **"Username already exists" (Future Feature)**

## 💡 Key Points to Remember

1. **Username Rules:**
   - 3-20 characters
   - Only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_)
   - Automatically lowercased
   - No spaces or special characters

2. **Full Name Rules:**
   - Must not be empty
   - Can include spaces
   - Any characters allowed

3. **Changes Take Effect Immediately:**
   - Profile updates save to Firebase instantly
   - Local state updates immediately
   - No page refresh needed!

4. **Videos Keep Original Username:**
   - When you post a video, your current username is saved
   - If you change your username later, old videos keep the old username
   - This is by design (like Instagram/TikTok)
